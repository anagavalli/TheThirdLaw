# Notes

Code from a 6 person student mobile game where I served as programming lead. Placed here primarily for archival purposes, will be cleaned up and made easily runnable Soon(TM).

# The Third Law

Code goes in source folder.

Assets go in assets.

Change CUGL only if you really, really need to.

Please create your own branch, merge changes into master when they're at a good place.

To get everything working:
1. Download CUGL demo project, get that working.
2. call "git init" in that directory.
3. call "git remote add origin <repo_address>"
4. call "git pull origin master"
5. you should be good.
