# Open Beta Release

We have successfully transfered our project from only working in Visual Studio to have a working and valid XCode project. The XCode project can be found under the "build-apple" folder labeled as "HelloWorld.xcodeproj." The project compiles and runs in both in Mac and an iOS device.

PLEASE NOTE: We have the app in test flight, so we added Walker to the iTunes Connect users (wmw2@cornell.edu). In the future we will use this to submit our game (i.e. Showcase).

# The Third Law

Code goes in source folder.

Assets go in assets.

Change CUGL only if you really, really need to.

Please create your own branch, merge changes into master when they're at a good place.

To get everything working:
1. Download CUGL demo project, get that working.
2. call "git init" in that directory.
3. call "git remote add origin <repo_address>"
4. call "git pull origin master"
5. you should be good.
